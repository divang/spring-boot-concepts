- Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a Micro Service.
- Micro Service is an architecture that allows the developers to develop and deploy services independently. Each service running has its own process and this achieves the lightweight model to support business applications.

- Advantages of Micro Service: Micro services offers the following advantages to its developers:
    Easy deployment
    Simple scalability
    Compatible with Containers
    Minimum configuration
    Lesser production time
  
- Advantages of Spring Boot:
    Easy to understand and develop spring applications
    Increases productivity
    Reduces the development time
    
- Goals:
    To avoid complex XML configuration in Spring
    To develop a production ready Spring applications in an easier way
    To reduce the development time and run the application independently
    Offer an easier way of getting started with the application

- Why Spring Boot?
    It provides a flexible way to configure Java Beans, XML configurations, and Database Transactions.
    It provides a powerful batch processing and manages REST endpoints.
    In Spring Boot, everything is auto configured; no manual configurations are needed.\
    It offers annotation-based spring application
    Eases dependency management
    It includes Embedded Servlet Container

- How does it work?
   @SpringBootApplication : The entry point of the spring boot application is the class contains @SpringBootApplication annotation and the main method.
   @ComponentScan: Spring Boot automatically scans all the components included in the project by using @ComponentScan annotation.
